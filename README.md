# MineSweep
This is my mini project on programming the well known Mine Sweep game.
The current version (1.0) does not include a user interface. 
To execute the file, run

./MineSweep

This will give a pop-out on which level of difficulty to select.


After selecting the difficulty, one sees a board output consists of 'E' meaning the empty grid.
To mimic mouse clicking on the grid, input


row_position  col_position action


where action = 1 means to reveal the grid, while action = 2 means to place a flag or remove a flag.
